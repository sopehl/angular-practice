# Used Commands

> To download bootstrap : npm install --save bootstrap@3

# Notes

To use the bootstrap css style around the whole angular application, we need to add the correct path of bootstrap.min.css file into the angular.json which contains some achitectural configuration.

Add the path of css files into the json "project.bootstrapapp.achitect.build.options.styles"
The path is "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"

# To start the server
